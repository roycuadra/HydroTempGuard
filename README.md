# HydroTempGuard

HydroTempGuard is an ESP8266-based project designed for monitoring water temperature in hydroponic systems, specifically for lettuce plants. The project uses a thermistor to measure water temperature and employs the Blynk app for real-time monitoring. If the water temperature exceeds a specified threshold, the system sends a notification through Blynk and activates a buzzer.

## Overview

This project is built on the ESP8266 platform and integrates with Blynk for remote monitoring. It ensures optimal water temperature conditions for lettuce plants in hydroponic setups. The system provides real-time temperature readings and alerts you when the temperature surpasses a predefined limit.

## Usage
- Power up your ESP8266 device.
- Open the Blynk app on your mobile device.
- Monitor the real-time water temperature for your lettuce plants on the app.
- If the temperature exceeds the defined threshold, a notification will be sent, and a buzzer will sound.
